  Remediarr is a lightweight webhook service that automatically fixes common media issues reported through Jellyseerr.
  When users report problems like "no audio" or "wrong movie", Remediarr detects the keywords, deletes problematic
  files, triggers new downloads, and closes the issue—all without manual intervention.

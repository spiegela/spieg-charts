  Jellyplist aims to be a companion app for your self-hosted Jellyfin Server. With Jellyplist you will be able to
  replicate/sync playlists from Spotify to your local Jellyfin account. Under the hood, it uses SpotDL for downloading
  the corresponding tracks from the available sources if a track isnÂ´t found in your local library.
